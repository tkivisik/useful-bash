## Reading .md Files

Files with an 'md' extension are regular plain text files following a predefined structure. You can read them

* locally as is when opening them with any text editor (e.g. Notepad)
* locally in a nicely formatted way by opening them with an viewer/editor capable of interpreting Markdown (Google for Markdown viewer *\<your operating system name\>*)
* online in a nicely formatted way at [https://github.com/tkivisik/useful-bash](https://github.com/tkivisik/useful-bash)
